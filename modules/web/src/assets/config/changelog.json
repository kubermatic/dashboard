      "description": "[ACTION REQUIRED] The latest Ubuntu 22.04 images ship with cloud-init 24.x package. This package has breaking changes and thus rendered our OSPs as incompatible. It's recommended to refresh your machines with latest provided OSPs to ensure that a system-wide package update, that updates cloud-init to 24.x, doesn't break the machines."
