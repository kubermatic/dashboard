# TEMPORARY WORKAROUND to avoid inconstant swagger generation:
# Because kubermatic repository still contains api types, swagger generation is not consistent.
# Sometime the  "x-go-package" point on dashboard repo and sometime on kubermatic repo.
# To avoid this exclude kubermatic packages with this option -x k8c.io/kubermatic/*
#
# this workaround will be removed once api will be totally removed from kubermatic repository
